            I was tasked to make a logo for this fictional company and you can see my process below.</p>

          <p class="text_center">For this step, I made eight designs in various distinct styles. At this stage, I was still unsure as to what aesthetic I wanted the company to have.
                        Therefore, I tried to make each design have its own distinct style. After receiving feedback on this stage, I took the three designs I thought to be most promising and iterated on them.</p>

              The design I felt was most promising after iterating was the couch design at the bottom.
              I did not disregard the iterations of the other two designs, however. I incorporated aspects of what worked for each design into the final after getting feedback and reviewing my work.</p>

                 There were many clashing colors and ideas, so my task was to strip the design down to the essentials to make the logo really pop.</p>
