Adding native plants to your landscape design can bring your yard to life with colorful native birds, butterflies and other wildlife. Many of our butterflies, moths and other insects have adapted to specific native plants for larval food and nectar sources; including native shrubs, trees and other plants in your yard can attract the beneficial insects and serve to provide seeds and fruit that our birds have become accustomed to seeking out throughout their annual life cycles.  Native plants in your yard can make even the most suburban of neighborhoods a much more friendly place for nesting and migrating birds alike.
